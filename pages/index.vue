      Just a guy on the internet. Student, zoomer, self-educated lazy programmer,
      procrastinator extraordinaire. Call me Leo.

      My preferred pronouns are
      <a href="https://en.pronouns.page/he">he/him</a>,
      or
      <a href="https://zh.pronouns.page/%E4%BB%96">他/你</a>
      in Chinese.
      <a href="https://en.pronouns.page/they">They/them</a> is fine if you're not sure.

      I like programs that are easy to understand for humans, fast to execute
      for computers, safe to run for years and decades to come.
      It is for this reason that I am a huge

      (<a href="https://rustacean.net">Ferris</a> would be proud of me).

      I like
      <a href="https://minecraft.net">Minecraft</a>. I've created a number
      of Minecraft mods in the past, but recently I have run out of attention
      and energy to maintain them and perfect them further – Minecraft is such
      a
      <em>horrible</em> platform to develop on, that neither mature toolchains
      like
      <a
        href="https://minecraftforge.net"
      >Forge</a> nor more innovative ones
      like
      <a href="https://fabricmc.net">Fabric</a> or
      <a href="https://quiltmc.org">Quilt</a>
      could save this dumpster fire. Let's just hope they'll get better; Mojang's
      beyond saving.

      I speak English and Mandarin, and write in English and (Simplified) Chinese.
      I'm also learning German. The language toggle switch is in the bottom-right
      corner, you're welcome.
      My timezone's in UTC+8, so you could probably figure out where I live now, lol.
